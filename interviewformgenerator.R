# Interview Form Generator

# Available roles depend on the file roles.csv
# the rows in roles.csv represent the 10 KSA's (which can be found as columns in questions.csv), and 
# are marked with 1 if they belong the profile, 0 if they're periferal

# The function intformgen takes the attributes rolename, 
# which should match exactly roles in roles.csv (there is no check)
# and the filename one wants to give the OUTPUT FORM
# As the code is here, it looks for the files in the same folder as the script runs.
